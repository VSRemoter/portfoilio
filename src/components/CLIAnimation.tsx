I'm Bob Jones, and I enjoy Quantitative Finance, Data Analytics, Math, Cryptography & Privacy Tools, Programming, and Communicating! Outside of my nerdy side, I absolutely love going to the gym, learning about nutrition and how the brain & body works, and I love playing basketball and strategy games like Backgammon, Chess, and Poker. I think I'm a great mix of being a nerdy kid but also just a fun person to engage with. I have a wide array of interests and find the world a fascinating thing. I hope you enjoy your stay, and find me as an interesting personâ€”whether you're a recruiter looking for your next employee or someone to connect and have a chill chat with.`;
