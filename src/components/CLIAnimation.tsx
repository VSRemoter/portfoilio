> Beyond tech, I have a wide array of interests, I'm big on weightlifting, basketball, fascinated by neuroscience, space, philosophy and love competitive strategy games like Chess, Backgammon, and Poker.
> I'm a nerd who loves tinkering with software, hardware, building better versions of simple tools (such as LuxPDF!!!) I use everyday, or reverse engineering a tool I find really interesting (like the TOR Browser). I delve everything into deeper detail in my Blog, where I talk about my projects, ideas, or what I learned in detail, answering questions like why I made a tool, why there useful and more! My home page talks about who I am in detail.
